This folder contains all non-filtered raw counts matrix used in AHCA. As the limitation of the size of the single file, some matrix files were divided into several files. Please 
merge the zip files of the same tissue before further analysis. Please note that the cell barcodes of the raw count's matrix are not prefixed with corresponding tissue names, 
while it is easy to match cells in the raw count's matrix and annotation files manually.
